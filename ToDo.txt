TODO:
- PDF: Some text in tables overlaps (see EBH-tables-issue.png).
- PDF: All titles should be centered, not left-aligned.
- PDF and EPUB: Title page and Copyright page should come before TOC.
- PDF: Images should be centered.
- HTML: Each chapter should be a separate page, with navigation in header and footer. Footer should also contain sharing links, without JavaScript, like here: https://svedic.org/programming/thanks-economist-fix-the-internet
- HTML: All external links should open in a new tab (target="_blank") 
- Make EBH-standalone.pdf (no gutter, not double sided).
- EBH-standalone.pdf: Cover image as first page (same as EPUB). Unfortunately, it seems that cover-image doesn't do anyhting: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/473
- EPUB and PDF: Reduce file sizes.

DONE:
+ EPUB: Add cover.
+ Split MD into chapters.
+ Rearange folders.
+ PDF page numbers should be in the middle of margin.
+ PDF should have 1.5 line spacing. 
+ PDF format should be 5x9in with gutter.
